    DiffREN(ps::AbstractRENParams{T}) where T

Construct a differentiable REN from its direct parameterisation.

`DiffREN` is an alternative to [`REN`](@ref) and [`WrapREN`](@ref) that computes the explicit parameterisation [`ExplicitRENParams`](@ref) every time the model is called, rather than storing it in the `REN` object.

This is slow and computationally inefficient if the model is called many times before updating the parameters (eg: in reinforcement learning). However, it can be trained just like any other [`Flux.jl`](http://fluxml.ai/Flux.jl/stable/) model (unlike [`WrapREN`](@ref)) and does not need to be re-created if the trainable parameters are updated (unlike [`REN`](@ref)).

See also [`AbstractREN`](@ref), [`REN`](@ref), and [`WrapREN`](@ref).
