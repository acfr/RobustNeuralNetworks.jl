Julia package for Recurrent Equilibrium Networks. This package is a work-in-progress. For now, you may find the following links useful:
- Tutorial on [developing Julia packages](https://julialang.org/contribute/developing_package/) by Chris Rackauckas (MIT)
- Documentation on [managing Julia packages](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/managing-packages/) and developing unregistered packages with `Pkg.jl`
- To contribute to the development of this package, clone this repository into `~/.julia/dev/RecurrentEquilibriumNetworks/` (for linux)
- Pull/push changes to the package as normal
- To use your local version of the package (best for development), type `dev RecurrentEquilibriumNetworks` instead of `add RecurrentEquilibriumNetworks` when using the package in another project.
