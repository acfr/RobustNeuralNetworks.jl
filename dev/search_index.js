Most existing neural network architectures have no robustness certificates, making them sensitive to poor data quality, adversarial attacks, and other input perturbations. The few neural network architectures proposed in recent years that offer solutions to this brittle behaviour rely on explicitly enforcing constraints during training to âsmoothâ the network response. These methods are computationally expensive, making them slow and difficult to scale up to complex real-world problems.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Recently, we proposed the Recurrent Equilibrium Network (REN) architecture as computationally efficient solutions to these problems. The REN architecture is flexible in that it includes all commonly used neural network models, such as fully-connected networks, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks. The weight matrices and bias vectors in a REN are directly parameterised to naturally satisfy behavioural constraints chosen by the user. For example, the user can build a REN with a given Lipschitz constant to ensure the output of the network is quantifiably less sensitive to unexpected input perturbations.
