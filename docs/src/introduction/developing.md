# Contributing to the Package

All contributors welcome! Please contact [nicholas.barbara@sydney.edu.au](mailto:nicholas.barbara@sydney.edu.au) with any questions.

## Installation for Development

If you would like to contribute the package, clone the repository into your `~/.julia/dev/` directory with

    git clone git@github.com:acfr/RobustNeuralNetworks.jl.git RobustNeuralNetworks

!!! info "The name matters"
    Note that the repository is named `RobustNeuralNetworks.jl` but your folder should be named `RobustNeuralNetworks` (no `.jl`). This is convention for Julia packages, and will ensure the package manager knows where to look.

    Also make sure you have cloned the repo inside your `~/.julia/dev/` folder for the following instructions to work. If the `dev/` directory does not exist, create it. 


Navigate to `~/.julia/dev/RobustNeuralNetworks/`, start a Julia session, and type the following in the REPL to activate the package.

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.activate(".")
Pkg.instantiate()
```

Check that the example in [Getting Started](@ref) runs without errors and matches the given output before continuing.


## Git Workflow

The package is just another git repository, so the development workflow is similar to most other projects.

- When developing features, please create a new branch labelled `feature/<some_descriptive_words>`. For example, the branch `feature/documentation` is where this documentation was first written and tested.

- If you notice a bug, please create a git issue and a new branch associated with that issue to let others know what you are working on. The branch should be deleted once the issue is closed.

- Submit pull requests once you have completed a new feature and tested it thorougly. All pull requests must be approved by at least one other developer of the package, and must pass the continuous integration pipeline.


## Package Structure

### Layout

The package is divided into four main directories:

- The `src/` folder contains all source code required for users of the package
- The `examples/` folder contains complete examples that are referenced in the documentation, and any assets/results required/produced by the examples.
- The `docs/` folder contains all files related to the documentation.
- The `test/` folder contains the main `runtests.jl` file and all other test files loaded within it.

Note that the `examples/` and `docs/` folders each have their own `Project.toml` (and `Manifest.toml`). Please do not add packages to the main `Project.toml` if they are not required by `RobustNeuralNetworks.jl` itself.

### Main file

The main file is `src/RobustNeuralNetworks.jl`. This imports all relevant packages, defines abstract types, includes code from other files, and exports the necessary components of our package. 

- All `using PackageName` statements should be included in this file.
- Only import packages that are absolutely required.
- If you only need one function from a package, import it explicitly (not the whole package).

When including files in the `src/` folder, the order often matters. Code should only ever be included with a single `include` statement in the main file. Please follow the convention outlined in the comments.


### Source files

The source files for our package are all in the `src/` directory, and are split into the following sub-directories.

- `src/Base/`: Contains code relevant to the core package functionality.
- `src/ParameterTypes/`: Contains the various REN and LBDN parameterisations, all subtypes of [`AbstractRENParams`](@ref) or [`AbstractLBDNParams`](@ref).
- `src/Wrappers/`: Contains wrappers used to define *explicit* (callable) REN and LBDN models (eg: subtypes of [`AbstractREN`](@ref) [`AbstractLBDN`](@ref)).


### Writing tests

Once you have written any code for this package, be sure to test it thoroughly. Write testing scripts in the `test/` directory.
- See the documentation for [`Test.jl`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Test/) for help with writing good package tests.
- Run all tests for the package with `] test` in the REPL.
- All tests will be run by the CI client when submitting pull requests to the main git branch.

Currently, the tests in place check that the various model parameterisations satisfy the constraints they should, and that the models are differentiable with `Flux.jl`.

### Writing documentation

If you would like to contribute the docs, [this page](https://m3g.github.io/JuliaNotes.jl/stable/publish_docs/) provides a great outline of the required workflow. In summary:

- All documentation should be in markdown (`.md` files) within the `docs/` folder
- Please add documentation in the `docs/src/` folder
- To build the docs locally from the `~/.julia/dev/RobustNeuralNetworks/` directory, activate the Julia REPL and enter the following.

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.activate("./docs")

using LiveServer
servedocs()
```
